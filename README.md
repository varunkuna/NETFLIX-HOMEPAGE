# Netflix_Home_Page_Using_HTML_And_CSS

This repository contains the code for building a Netflix-inspired home page using HTML and CSS. The project aims to recreate the visual design and layout of the Netflix home page, providing a starting point for creating similar interfaces or learning web development techniques.

## Features

- Responsive design: The web page adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience on desktop and mobile devices.
- Interactive components: The page includes interactive elements such as buttons, dropdown menus, and hover effects.
- Dynamic content: Placeholder content is used to mimic Netflix's movie and TV show recommendations.
- CSS styling: The stylesheets provide a sleek and modern look, resembling the Netflix branding.
1. **Navigation Bar:**
   - The top of the page features a fixed navigation bar with a black background (`#141414`).
   - On the left, the bold, white text "NETFLIX" serves as the logo.
   - On the right, there’s a horizontal list of navigation links (`Home`, `TV Shows`, `Movies`, `Latest`, `My List`), also in white text. These links are evenly spaced and change color slightly when hovered over.

2. **Banner Section:**
   - Below the navigation bar, there is a large, full-width banner section that takes up 80% of the viewport height.
   - The banner has a background image (`banner.jpg`) that covers the entire area, positioned centrally.
   - In the center of the banner, there’s a heading in large, white text (e.g., "Popular on Netflix").
   - Below the heading, two buttons are aligned: a red "Play" button and a gray "More Info" button. These buttons are semi-transparent, with rounded corners, and change slightly in appearance when hovered over.

3. **Movie Thumbnails Grid:**
   - The section below the banner displays a title, "Trending Now," in white, large font.
   - Beneath this title is a grid layout featuring movie thumbnails. Each thumbnail is a small image representing a movie.
   - The grid is responsive, adjusting the number of columns based on the screen size. The images have rounded corners and slightly enlarge when hovered over, creating a subtle zoom effect.
   - The background of the entire page is black, creating a sleek, cinematic feel.

### **Interaction:**
- The navigation bar remains at the top as you scroll down, providing easy access to other sections of the site.
- The buttons in the banner and the thumbnails in the movie grid have interactive hover effects, enhancing the user experience.

This setup mimics the general style and functionality of Netflix's homepage, providing a simple yet elegant design for users to navigate and explore movie content.
